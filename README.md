# Context
This dataset was downloaded from kaggle website which is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Problem
Did you know 72.9 million people in India had diabetes as of 2017? Alarming as the number is, it is expected to be 134 million by 2045. Early and accurate diagnosis goes a long way in preserving the health and quality of life of the patient. This is where machine learning can be of help. Machine learning has been applied to many aspects of the medical field. Using it to predict diabetes based on a personâ€™s regular physical examination data, can enable patients and doctors to better deal with this chronic illness.

# Inspiration
To build a classification model which will predict the onset of diabetes with high accuracy.

## About the data
This dataset describes the medical records for Pima Indians and whether or not each patient will have an onset of diabetes within ve years.

## Fields description follow:
preg = Number of times pregnant

plas = Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

pres = Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

skin = Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

test = 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

mass = Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

pedi = Diabetes pedigree function

age = Age (years)

class = Class variable (1:tested positive for diabetes, 0: tested negative for diabetes)
